# Fines

The proportion about people fined are about the same across time.

```{r}
durham_1819 <- misdemeanor %>%
  filter(sentsas > "2018-01-01")

durham_1819 %>%
  mutate(year = factor(if_else(sentsas > "2019-01-01", 2019, 2018))) %>%
  mutate(fineflag = factor(durham_1819$"_fineflag")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(fineflag) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = fineflag)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") 
```

include other years
